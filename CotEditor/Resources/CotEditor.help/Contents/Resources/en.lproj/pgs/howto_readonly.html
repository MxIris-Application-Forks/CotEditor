<h1>Make read-only documents in CotEditor on Mac</h1>

<p>In CotEditor, you can make a document read-only so it can’t be edited, or lock it so it can’t be edited or deleted.</p>

<p>If you own a read-only or locked document, you can edit it after removing its read-only state or unlocking it.</p>
</figure>

<h2>Preventing from being edited</h2>

<p>CotEditor can temporarily prevent a document from being edited to avoid unintended data modifications while reading. This state is only valid while the document is open in CotEditor and is not saved to the file.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To prevent a document from being edited, do one of the following:<ul>
		<li>Choose Format &gt; Prevent Editing.</li>
		<li>From an AppleScript, set the <code>editable</code> property of the <code>document</code> object to <code>false</code>.</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li>To open a document as read-only, do one of the following:<ul>
		<li>Choose File &gt; Open, and select the “Open as read-only” checkbox in the Open dialog.</li>
		<li>From the <a href="about_cot.html">cot command-line tool</a>, open documents with the <code>--readonly</code> (<code>-r</code>) option.</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li>To allow editing a document being prevented from editing, choose Format &gt; Allow Editing.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also customize the toolbar and add the Edit toolbar item to quickly switch between preventing and allowing editing.</p>

<p>When a document is prevented from being edited, a read-only icon <object type="image/svg+xml" class="symbol" data="../../Shared/gfx/pencil.slash.svg" height="13">(pencil with slash)</object> appears on the status bar.</p>


<h2>Lock</h2>

<p>The lock is the feature in the macOS system to protect documents from being accidentally changed or deleted. This state is saved in the file and persists when working with the document from other apps on Mac.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>To lock a document, place the pointer to the right of the document title at the top of the document window, click the arrow that appears, then select Locked.</li>
	<li>To unlock a document, deselect Locked.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also lock or unlock a document from the Finder. See <a href="https://support.apple.com/ja-jp/guide/mac-help/mchlp1342/mac" rel="external">Lock a document on Mac</a> for details of the Lock feature on Mac.</p>
